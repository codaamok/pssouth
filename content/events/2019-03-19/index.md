## Session 1

Google Cloud PowerShell 101.

## Session 2

Multi-threading in your PowerShell scripts using Runspaces - a "real world" use case.

[Nigel Boulton](https://twitter.com/n_boulton) will show us on a "real world" use case, learn how to make use of PowerShell Runspaces (an alternative to PowerShell Jobs) to enable multi-threading in your scripts, and discover some tips and techniques to overcome some of the hurdles that this approach brings.

Nigel Boulton is a Senior Infrastructure Consultant at Hampshire County Council, and a co-organiser of the PowerShell Southampton User Group. He has worked in IT for almost 25 years, primarily with Microsoft, Citrix, VMware and now Nutanix products. He is a long-time scripter and has been using PowerShell since its launch in 2006. He also blogs very occasionally at https://nigelboulton.co.uk.
