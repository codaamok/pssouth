## Session 2

Adventures in DevOps: Part 2. 

[Jonathan Medd](https://twitter.com/jonathanmedd) follows on from September's part 1, more tales from the trenches of working within a software engineering organisation. Having previously discussed moving from waterfall to agile based projects we move onto developing tooling and procedures for a DevOps focused method of software delivery.
