Daniel Krebs ([@Dan1el42](https://twitter.com/Dan1el42)) will explain what Chef Habitat is and which problems the product is designed to solve. With the basics out of the way, we will switch into demo mode to build/package two different example applications, deploy and run them in a test environment. As part of the basics & demos, Daniel will explain and show how Chef Habitat uses PowerShell.

Daniel is a DevOps Systems Engineer and PowerShell Toolmaker.
