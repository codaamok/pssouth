[Patch My PC](https://patchmypc.com) sponsors PowerShell Southampton's first in-person meetup since the pandemic!

** **Only RSVP if you can physically attend** ** I am using the number of attendees RSVP'ed as a means to determine how many to cater food for.

Three speakers are lined up, sandwiches, tea, and coffee will be served, and 2 raffle prizes to be won at the end (see below)!

This event is in-person only and will not be live streamed. The sessions might be recorded - to be decided! If they will be, they will be uploaded to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/PowerShellSouthampton)!
