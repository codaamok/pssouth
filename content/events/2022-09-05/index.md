[Patch My PC](https://patchmypc.com) sponsors PowerShell Southampton's first in-person meetup since the pandemic!

** **Only RSVP if you can physically attend** ** I am using the number of attendees RSVP'ed as a means to determine how many to cater food for.

Three speakers are lined up, sandwiches, tea, and coffee will be served, and 3 raffle prizes to be won at the end (see below)!

This event is in-person only and will not be live streamed. The sessions might be recorded - to be decided! If they will be, they will be uploaded to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/PowerShellSouthampton)!

### Location
The venue is [Holiday Inn Southampton-Eastleigh M3,Jct13, an IHG Hotel](https://goo.gl/maps/bYNk1jtLSs5FDmpy9), on Leigh Road, **in the Maple meeting room**.

It's 1 mile from [Eastleigh train station](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Eastleigh,+Eastleigh/Holiday+Inn+Southampton-Eastleigh+M3,Jct13,+an+IHG+Hotel,+Leigh+Rd,+Eastleigh+SO50+9PG/@50.9692754,-1.3639986,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x487472fc35d8be9f:0xd5365bd683330775!2m2!1d-1.3501705!2d50.9692091!1m5!1m1!1s0x4874730fb7d3bbc1:0xcea4a9f117a01e60!2m2!1d-1.3691899!2d50.9713174!3e2) and, literally, just off of the M3 at junction 13.

### Speakers
**Adam Bacon ([@psdevuk](https://twitter.com/psdevuk))** - Documentation with Retype and PowerShell! Adam will walk us through on how to get started writing documentation with Retype. Learn how to use Adam's [Retype PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Retype/1.0.1) and how he made [this website](https://powershellretype.netlify.app/), using PowerShell!

**Jaap Brasser ([@Jaap_Brasser](https://twitter.com/Jaap_Brasser))** - Azure Functions, the DevOps way! You're using Azure Functions, now the next step is... how can we make sure that everything runs as intended when it's deployed. Using proper CI/CD pipelines can be beneficial but hard to setup. Join us in this session to learn about the power of automated pipelines to create PowerShell Azure Functions, faster, more efficient and with more power!

**Brett Miller ([@BrettMiller_IT](https://twitter.com/BrettMiller_IT))** - Managing Azure resources with PowerShell and Azure Functions! What do you do when you need to migrate and modernize a ton of Azure resources with zero downtime? You've probably heard of Azure functions, but maybe you're not sure where to get started or what you can do with them. Maybe you use Azure functions but aren't using them to their full capability. This session will show you how you can use PowerShell and Azure functions to manage your Azure resources. From there, we will dive into an advanced real-life migration scenario utilising Azure Functions and PowerShell to automate the migration of thousands of Azure resources with zero downtime.
