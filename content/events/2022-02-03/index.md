Jakub Jareš ([@nohwnd](https://twitter.com/nohwnd)) will be breaking the ice for us with Pester. You can expect a rundown of what Pester is and how to get started with it, so you can start automating the testing of your PowerShell code!

The session will be streamed live to our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/PowerShellSouthampton) and the recording will be made available for you to watch afterwards.
