Rob Sewell ([@sqldbawithbeard](https://twitter.com/sqldbawithbeard)) is giving us an introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and show you how useful they could be for you in your daily work-life.

Jupyter Notebooks are best known as tools for Data Scientists to display Python, Spark or R scripts.

A Jupyter Notebook enables you to share words, images, code AND code results. .NET interactive Jupyter notebooks add c sharp, f sharp and PowerShell core to the mix.

The session will be streamed live to our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/PowerShellSouthampton) and the recording will be made available for you to watch afterwards.
