Josh Duffney ([@joshduffney](https://twitter.com/joshduffney)) is giving us something a bit different where you get a front-row seat to see what it looks like to use Ansible for deploying and configuring Azure virtual machines.

Learn Ansible ad-hoc commands, creating Ansible inventories, and how to connect to Windows and Linux VMs with Ansible.

Josh is a Microsoft MVP and author. He has climbed through from L1, to sysadmin of all the things and has reached the heights as a Site Reliability Engineer at Stack Overflow. Josh has recently announced his self-published book, [Become Ansible](https://becomeansible.com).

Josh is also an advocate for supporting positive habits which boost productivity and mental capacity via digital decluttering. His blog (http://duffney.io) on these topics are very insightful.

The session will be streamed live to our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/PowerShellSouthampton) and the recording will be made available for you to watch afterwards.
