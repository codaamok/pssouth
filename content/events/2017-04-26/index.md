I am gathering interest in a UK South Coast PowerShell User Group for coders of all experience levels.

The purpose of this initial meetup is to test the viability of running a PowerShell meetup in Southampton on a regular meetup.

Come and meet us in The Vestry in Southampton and we'll discuss our plans for making this a regular event.
