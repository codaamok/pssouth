Donna Ryan ([@TheNotoriousDRR](https://twitter.com/TheNotoriousDRR)) is giving us an exciting introduction to building GUIs with PowerShell!

The target audience for this will be for novices / beginners in terms of writing GUIs with PowerShell, but there is some reasonable proficiency required with PowerShell.

Donna is a Enterprise Mobility Microsoft MVP and is well-known for many community contributions with [MSEndpointMgr](https://msendpointmgr.com), especially WIM Witch.

WIM Witch is a GUI solution for Windows image customisations. Donna will be sharing her knowledge which enabled her to build WIM Witch.

You can read more about WIM Witch [here](https://msendpointmgr.com/2019/10/04/wim-witch-a-gui-driven-solution-for-image-customization).

The session will be streamed live to our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/PowerShellSouthampton) and the recording will be made available for you to watch afterwards.
