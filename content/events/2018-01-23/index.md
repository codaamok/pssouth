Octopus Deploy was announced as a challenger in Gartner Report Application Release Automation in 2017. 

In the first part of the session, [Ebru Cucen](https://twitter.com/ebrucucen) will walk through the Octopus Deployments features, and learn how you can design a multi-tenant deployment. Integrating with a CI server Jenkins, we will deploy our application to Azure. In the second part, we will go through the advanced features of Octopus Deploy, such as channels, promotions, auditing, and user management.

Ebru Cucen is .NET Developer turned into DevOps Architect, loves automation, building pipelines. She is co-running the PowerShell London User Group.
