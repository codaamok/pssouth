## Session 2

Developing and Testing Cross Platform Compatible Modules with PowerShell Core

[Mark Wragg](https://twitter.com/markwragg)'s session will look at some of the considerations you need to make when authoring PowerShell code that you want to run successfully on multiple platforms via PSCore, along with how you can leverage a CI service like AppVeyor to test your code works successfully on both Windows and Linux.
