We will cover what Terraform is, what it does and why you should want to use it. Demos will include using what we've learnt in a simple environment, as well as how to use Terraform as a team and in a CI/CD pipeline.

Will is a DevOps engineer. He's been using PowerShell since 2011 and has spent the last year doing all things Azure & Terraform.
