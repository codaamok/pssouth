Speaker name ([@twitterhandle](https://twitter.com/twitterhandle)) is kicking us off for 2021 with by sharing his tips for writing PowerShell code that will reduce the occurrences of errors and unexpected behaviour which helps increase reliability and user confidence.

Non-PowerShell conversant folk tend to run away screaming when they see those red errors, so learn how to avoid them completely. Make them intelligible/useful or rectify the errors within the script so users see no indication that anything was ever amiss.

The session will be streamed live to our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/PowerShellSouthampton) and the recording will be made available for you to watch afterwards.
