## Session 1

The PowerShell Standards Agency – Write better code for Everybody

[Paul Broadwith](https://twitter.com/pauby) will be talking about writing quality code. There's the quick way or there's the right way. In this session we will look at good practices and standards to follow when writing PowerShell to make it easier for you and others to trust and reuse your code.

By the end of this session you'll have a guide to being a better PowerShell citizen, following best practices and sharing your code with others.

Become a member of the PowerShell Standards Agency* (Not a real thing) and write better code for Everybody.

Paul: I'm a Senior Technical Engineer for Chocolatey Software, Inc., living and working in Scotland. I've worked in IT for over 25 years now. As somebody kindly put it, I’ve been about a bit. I love to automate through PowerShell and I love to teach others the same.

## Session 2

Power BI and PowerShell - A Match Made in Heaven

Power BI is the shiny new tech for processing and visualizing data in the Microsoft Data Platform. However, the plumbing in the background does need managing (even if it is cloud-based and supposedly automagic).

In this session we will take a look at how to manage your datasets, security, monitor licensing and more, all through the ultimate administration interface: PowerShell!

You'll leave the session with an overview of the management capabilities of Power BI and couple that knowledge with the awesome power (and automation possibilities) of PowerShell
