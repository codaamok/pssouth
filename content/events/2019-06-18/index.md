## Session 1

If you've been to one of our previous Meetups, you may well have seen one of our regular attendees [Matt Penny](https://twitter.com/salisbury_matt) making sketchnotes of each session and publishing online, e.g.:

They've proven very popular, so we thought it would be great for Matt to talk to us about how he makes them and the thought process behind it.

Matt will discuss:
- what sketchnotes are, hopefully with a bit of live demonstration)
- the way he does sketchnotes
- how doing sketchnotes has benefited him

Matt is a Database and Automation Engineer at Simplyhealth. He has been working with PowerShell and SQL Server for 8 years or so, and with oracle and various flavours of unix for many years before that. He has been putting sketchnotes on the internet since 2013.

## Session 2

Ansible is becoming an increasingly popular tool for automation and orchestration of IT infrastructure. In this session we will take an introductory look at Ansible as a platform and then some real-world examples, insight and tales from the trenches when using it with PowerShell and Windows based systems.

[Jonathan Medd](https://twitter.com/jonathanmedd) is a Cloud Automation Engineer at Atos. A PowerShell MVP since 2010 and VMware vExpert since 2011, he is the co-author of VMware vSphere PowerCLI Reference 1st and 2nd editions and co-organiser of both PSDayUK, a PowerShell one day conference in the UK, and PowerShell Southampton.
