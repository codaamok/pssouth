When you need to integrate with others systems for automation, PowerShell is your friend. In this session we will look at ways you can work with different types of data in PowerShell that you may need to deal with when integrating various systems. Sometimes there are built-in cmdlets to use, sometimes there are not and we need to look at alternative approaches. We will also cover some gotchas from real world experiences that have caught us out in the past. Whether you are using text, CSV or Excel files, or data from web services such as XML, JSON or YAML we'll help you get on the right track to being successful with data.
