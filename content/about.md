We are a PowerShell User Group on the South Coast of the UK for coders of all experience levels, typically meeting in Southampton, United Kingdom.

PowerShell is used extensively not only on the Microsoft Windows ecosystem, but also to manage many third party systems, such as Citrix and VMware. In 2016 it was made open source and is now fully available cross-platform for Linux and MacOS. 

If you are an experienced PowerShell user we'll offer an opportunity for you to share with others, or if you are only just starting out then this will be the place for you to learn more.

You can learn more about us, see our previous events and follow us on:

PowerShell Southampton was founded in 2017 by Jonathan Medd, Nigel Boulton and Graham Beer. 

In 2020, the original founders of the group were seeking new owners and organisers. Adam Cook became the new organiser of the group.
