We have created a new website for the group, and also have a new logo!

We hope this will be another means of sharing information with you. Previously, we solely depended on Meetup for sharing content and communicating with people interested in PowerShell Southampton. 

Meetup works fine, however it is becoming increasingly more expensive. For the foreseeable we will keep using Meetup, because despite its cost it is still a reasonably successful way to co-ordinate and promote our events. However it is possible we might consider something else.

We hope to bring on [sponsors](/sponsors) to increase the exposure of useful companies and tools within the community. This should also be an opportunity for us with operating costs.

## Logo

David Neale ([@reverentgeek](https://twitter.com/reverentgeek)) made our new logo and he did a great job.

If you like his style or want to see more of his work, [check out his online store](https://reverentgeek.com/) where you can order your own custom artwork. He sometimes streams live while he's drawing [on his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_JKDmQC4pY-WjmksjSSQPw), too.

## Hugo and hosting

The website is hosted on Azure blob storage, generated by Hugo and the markdown content is stored on GitHub. If you want to learn more about Hugo, I highly recommend you checkout this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3) - it's a good starting point.

Using a static site generator enables us to store our content on GitHub, write it in Markdown and leverage the cheap costs (mostly free, actually) of Azure blob storage as our web host.
